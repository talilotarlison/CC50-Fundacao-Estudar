    <h1>CS50: Introduction to Computer Science</h1>
    <p>An introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming.</p>
    <h2>Course description</h2>
    <p>This is CS50x , Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art
      of programming for majors and non-majors alike, with or without prior programming experience. An entry-level
      course taught by David J. Malan, CS50x teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems
      efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management,
      security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and
      HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. The
      on-campus version of CS50x , CS50, is Harvard's largest course. </p>
    <p>Students who earn a satisfactory score on 9 problem sets (i.e., programming assignments) and a final project are
      eligible for a certificate. This is a self-paced course–you may take CS50x on your own schedule.</p>
